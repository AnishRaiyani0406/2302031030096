            <p class="art-therapy-is1">
              Art therapy is a mental health profession that enriches the lives
              of individuals, families, and communities through active
              art-making, creative process, applied psychological theory, and
              human experience within a psychotherapeutic relationship.

              Especially when people are struggling, facing a challenge, or even
              a health crisis —their own words or language fails them. During
              these times, an art therapist can help clients express themselves
              in ways beyond words or language. Art therapists are trained in
              art and psychological theory and can help clients integrate
              nonverbal cues and metaphors that are often expressed through the
              creative process.

            <p class="art-therapists-work">
              Art therapists work with individuals of all ages, including
              children who are experiencing behavioral challenges or those with
              Autism Spectrum Disorder. They assist people and caregivers in
              health crises; victims of violence or other trauma—including our
              military service members and student survivors of mass shootings;
              older adults with dementia; and anyone that needs help coping with
              life’s challenges.
